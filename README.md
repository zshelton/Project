# Project
I will be adding to this pretty regularly. So any and all comments or advice is welcome! Thank you!
10/11/2017- First Project uploaded from scratch. New to this program so after getting a feel of it and mapping out what I wanted to accomplish I came up with this. Hope you enjoy. I understand the "Code" is messy but again this was my first time. Will go bac and iron it out at a later date.-Z.S.
